1) This is an implemetation of Restricted Boltzmann machine in accordance to 
Prof. Hiton's instructions (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/guideTR.pdf).

2) It is important because more and more development needs to be done on C++ 
compared to Python as Python is much slower compartive to C++

3) I would encourage people to use my code for their development or research 
purposes.

4) To run this code you can try the following command on LINUX:
$g++ rbm.cpp -o RBM
$./RBM <inputs
